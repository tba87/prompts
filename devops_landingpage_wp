üéØ Prompt to Use with ChatGPT or Other AI Assistants
Act as a skilled WordPress web developer and UI/UX designer experienced in building portfolio landing pages for DevOps engineers.

I‚Äôm building a one-page portfolio website using the Astra theme in WordPress with the following free plugins already installed: Advanced Custom Fields (ACF), Contact Form 7, LiteSpeed Cache, Rank Math SEO, and Stackable Blocks.

The portfolio is for an aspiring DevOps Engineer with:

10 years of experience in IT Helpdesk/Support

Currently learning: Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, Jenkins, AWS, Git, Ansible, SonarQube

Actively working on personal DevOps projects to showcase soon

Please help me design a professional, modern, informative, and visually dynamic landing page that‚Äôs also lightweight and responsive. I want:

‚öôÔ∏è Site Setup Goals:
One-page layout (with option to expand later)

Dynamic light/dark mode (based on system or time of day)

Parallax scrolling and subtle floating icons (not performance-heavy)

Separate custom blocks per section using Stackable + ACF

Use of additional CSS for clean styling and animations

A Contact Form that both emails and stores data in WP

Designed-in blog section (even if content isn't live yet)

üß± Sections:
Hero (with dynamic greeting, background animation, name, short tagline)

About Me (friendly-professional tone, mention journey from helpdesk to DevOps)

Experience (list of roles + skills)

Skills (DevOps tool stack)

DevOps Projects (placeholder for now)

Contact (basic form with email + WP storage)

Blog (linked or sectioned for future)

üìù Additional Instructions:
Help me generate content for each section based on the above context (you can ask clarifying questions).

Suggest CSS snippets for parallax effects, floating icons, button hover, and light/dark transitions.

Walk me through how to structure this in WordPress using Astra and Stackable blocks ‚Äî step-by-step with screenshots (or annotated descriptions if no images).

Ensure all recommendations use only free tools or plugins.

Optional: Suggest ways to optimize SEO, performance, and accessibility.
