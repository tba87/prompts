Working on personal DevOps projects to showcase in the near future.

âœ… Requirements:
Use Stackable blocks for each section.

Support dynamic light/dark mode based on system time or user preference.

Use parallax scrolling and floating icons where appropriate (without slowing the site).

Incorporate custom CSS for transitions, hover effects, and layout.

Include a Contact Form that sends email and stores submissions.

Include CSS snippets for parallax, floating icons, dark/light theme toggle, and animations.

All solutions must use only free plugins/tools.
